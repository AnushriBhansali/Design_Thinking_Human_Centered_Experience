## üßë‚Äçüî¨ Research Methodologies  

To create an effective learning experience, we adopted a **user-centered design process** supported by the following methods:  

1. **Empathy Mapping:**  
   - Identified challenges, emotions, and frustrations faced by novice programmers.  
   - Recognized the diverse approaches to learning and coding.  

2. **"How Might We" Questions:**  
   - Guided feature development with questions like:  
     - "How might we create a debugging experience that simplifies logic?"  
     - "How might we support hands-on learners with interactive tasks?"  

3. **Worst Possible Ideas Exercise:**  
   - Encouraged unconventional thinking to avoid design pitfalls.  
   - Examples included:  
     - A debugger that randomly rearranges code lines.  
     - A documentation system replacing comments with emojis.  

4. **Scenario-Based Evaluations:**  
   - Participants reviewed static UI designs to simulate workflows and provide feedback.  

5. **User Feedback Surveys:**  
   - Collected data on clarity, usability, and engagement.
